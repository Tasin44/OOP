üîê Main Concept of Encapsulation :

    Bundles data (attributes) and methods (functions) into a single unit (class).
    Restricts direct access to some components, hiding internal implementation details.
This protects the internal state of an object by:

    Hiding internal details from the outside world.

    Allowing controlled access through methods.

    Preventing accidental modification of important data.

In Python, this is done using access modifiers:

    Public: accessible everywhere.

    Protected (_): should be accessed only within the class or subclass.

    Private (__): hidden from outside access.
    

Protected Members:
Protected members are those that are intended to be accessed only within the class 
and its subclasses.
In Python, protected members are defined by prefixing the member 
name with a single underscore (_).

'''
"""
*************************
If you want to access private attributes or private methods outside of their defining class (even in a child class), 
you must use the name-mangled format, which is _ParentClassName__attribute or _ParentClassName__method().

This is because Python uses name mangling to make private members "inaccessible" outside the defining class. 
***********************
"""
#In Python,encapsulation is achieved using private and protected members.

'''
Examples of Protected and private attribute in Encapsulation :
'''

#EXAMPLE-1(Protected Attribute )
class Protected:
    def __init__(self):
        self._age = 30  # Protected attribute, it's accessible in it's own class

class Subclass(Protected):
    def display_age(self):
        print(self._age)  # Protected attribute is also Accessible in subclass

obj = Subclass()#must be call the subclass always 
obj.display_age() # This method within the subclass accesses the protected attribute and prints its value. 

'''
Why not I create _init_ on the subclass?
Subclass doesn't define its own __init__, so it automatically uses the __init__ from the parent class (Protected).
That means _age is still initialized properly.
‚úÖ You can access _age in the subclass because it's inherited.
'''
========================================================================================================================================================================


#EXAMPLE-2(Protected Attribute access with the classname )
class Base(object):
    def __init__(self):
        self._a=2
class derived(Base):
    def __init__(self):
       Base.__init__(self)#name mangling
       print("Calling protected member of base class: ",self._a)
       self._a+=3
       print("Calling protected member of child class: ",self._a)

obj1=derived()

'''
Why  I create _init_ on the subclass?

Here, derived class overrides the parent's __init__.
Therefore, if you don‚Äôt call Base.__init__(self) explicitly, _a won't be initialized.
So you must call the parent constructor to make sure _a exists before accessing it.

üß† Summary :
Is it mandatory to use __init__ in the derived class to access protected attributes?

    No, it's not mandatory if:

        You don‚Äôt override the constructor in the subclass.

        The parent class initializes the protected attribute in its own __init__.

    Yes, it's necessary if:

        You override __init__ in the subclass.

        Then you must explicitly call the parent's __init__() to initialize protected attributes defined there.

# Example -3 (Private Attribute) 

class Base:
    def __init__(self):
        self.__privateattribute=5

class derived(Base):

    def __init__(self):
        Base.__init__(self)
        print("Calling private attribute of Base Class: ",self._Base__privateattribute)
        self._Base__privateattribute+=7
        print("Calling private attribute of Child class: ",self._Base__privateattribute)
    
obj=derived()

# output:
# Calling private attribute of Base Class:  5
# Calling private attribute of Child class:  12

# ‚úÖsuper() gives you a way to call methods (protected or public) or constructor (__init__) defined in the parent class(super class) in a child class.
# ‚úÖMain Use Case: super() lets you call a parent class‚Äôs methods or constructor (__init__) without explicitly naming the parent class.

# ‚úÖPrivate Members Limitation: It cannot directly access private attributes/methods(starting with double __) due to Python‚Äôs name-mangling. 
# ‚úÖProtected Attributes Limitation:super() is not used to directly access protected attributes like self._b.
# You access those via methods (e.g., getter functions) if needed.

# Key Takeaways:
#     ‚úÖUsed for inheritance (calling parent class methods).
#     ‚úÖAvoids hardcoding the parent class name.
#     ‚úÖ‚úÖ‚úÖWorks with protected/public methods, not works for private method or private/protected attributes.


'''
Connection Between Encapsulation & super()

    Encapsulation protects data inside a class.
    super() accesses inherited methods while respecting encapsulation (cannot bypass private members).

In the above example:
# _protected_attribute and _protected_method are protected members.
# Protected members can be accessed within the class and its subclasses.
# Accessing protected members outside the class or its subclasses is technically allowed but is discouraged.
