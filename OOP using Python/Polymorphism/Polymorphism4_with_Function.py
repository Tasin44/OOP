Polymorphism with a Function and objects: 

It is also possible to create a function that can take any object, 
allowing for polymorphism. In this example, let’s create a function called “func()” 
which will take an object which we will name “obj”. 
Though we are using the name ‘obj’, any instantiated object will be able
to be called into this function.
