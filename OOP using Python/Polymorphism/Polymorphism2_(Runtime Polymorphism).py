'''
The below code shows how Python can use two different class types, in the same way.
We create a for loop that iterates through a tuple of objects. 
Then call the methods without being concerned about which class type each object is.
We assume that these methods actually exist in each class. 
'''
'''
Runtime Polymorphism: Occurs when the behavior of a method is determined at runtime based on the type of the object.
