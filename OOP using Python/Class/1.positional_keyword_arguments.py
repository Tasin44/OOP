'''
Functions defined outside of classes
are standalone and can be called directly 
without needing to create an instance of a class. 
Here greet and greetings are called directly without any class and class instance 
'''

'''
The greet and greetings method works 
without using any __init__ method 
because it's not part of a class. 
In Python, you can define functions
outside of classes, and they don't 
require an __init__ method.
