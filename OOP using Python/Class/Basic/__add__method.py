__add__() magic method
Python __add__() method adds two objects and returns 
a new object as a resultant object in Python. 

# methods with double underscores (__method__) are special methods that have specific meanings.
# The __add__ method is designed to handle addition operations 
# between two instances of the same class(here Person class)
# If you define the __add__ method in the Person class, 
# it's specifically for handling addition operations involving instances of the Person class.
# You can't directly use the __add__ method of the Person class to perform addition 
# operations with instances of other classes ,
# if you want to do so,u will get TypeError

'''
Q: In __add__, why I've to do self.age,self.name, I'm doing the same thing once in __init__, then why I've to do it again?
'''

'''
You must use self. to access object data inside each methods of the class.
__init__ stores data, while other methods retrieve it via self..

âœ… Why do you use self.age, self.name, etc. again in __add__?

Because:

    In Python, self.name, self.age, etc. are attributes stored in the object.
    When youâ€™re in a method like __add__, youâ€™re working with two objects: self and other.
    You need to access each object's stored values, like this:

self.age        # from first object
other.age       # from second object


ðŸ”¸ Didnâ€™t I already set those in __init__?

Yes! You set them once in __init__, and they are now part of each object.
But in other methods (like __add__), you must refer to them using self or other to access those saved values.
Youâ€™re not redefining â€” youâ€™re using what was set earlier.
