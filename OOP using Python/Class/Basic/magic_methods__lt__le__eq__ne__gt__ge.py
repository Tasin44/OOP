Why _lt, ___le__ this type of magic method is need? Can't i use if else inside the cls to do the same work?
    Enables comparison operations (<, <=) between objects.
    Without them, if obj1 < obj2 would raise TypeError.

'''
in lexicographical order, (5, 2) is greater than (3, 4) because 5 > 3.
Therefore, point1 > point2 evaluates to True.

✅ Why not use if-else/Why Magic Methods uses instead of if/else??

    No, because Python expects special methods for operators.

    "if obj1 < obj2" automatically calls obj1.__lt__(obj2).

    Without __lt__, Python wouldn’t know how to compare them.

#Example:

class Box:
    def __init__(self, weight):
        self.weight = weight

    def __lt__(self, other):  # define < between boxes
        return self.weight < other.weight

box1 = Box(10)
box2 = Box(20)

print(box1 < box2)  # True, because 10 < 20

'''
Without __lt__, Python will throw an error:
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Box' and 'Box'
'''
#like if we do(another example):

class Person:
    def __init__(self, age):
        self.age = age

p1 = Person(25)
p2 = Person(30)

if p1 < p2:  # TypeError: '<' not supported
    print("p1 is younger")
