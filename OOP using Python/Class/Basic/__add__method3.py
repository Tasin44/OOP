'''
If you use return instead of raise,
the code will still work fine, but it changes the behavior of the __add__ method slightly.
Both approaches are valid, but they convey different intentions:
(i)Using return indicates that the addition operation is performed and returns a result.
(ii)Using raise indicates that the addition operation cannot be performed due to incompatible types, 
and it raises an exception.
