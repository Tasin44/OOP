##Explanation of try and except:
try: 
This block contains code that might cause an exception. 
In your case,it attempts to convert deposit_amount to a float.

except:
This block executes if an exception occurs in the try block. 
Specifically,if a ValueError occurs 
(which happens if the input cannot be converted to a float), 
the except block will run, printing an error message.


##Can you use try and except only in if and elif?

No,you can use try and except anywhere in your code. 
They are not limited to if and elif statements. 
You can use them in any block of code where you 
expect an exception might occur and want to handle it gracefully.
