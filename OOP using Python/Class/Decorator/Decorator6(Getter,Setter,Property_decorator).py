#Using normal function to achieve getters and setters behaviour
#1st approach(single _protected attribute )
class Geek: 
	def __init__(self, age = 0): 
		self._age = age 
	
	# getter method 
	def get_age(self): 
		return self._age 
	
	# setter method 
	def set_age(self, x): 
		self._age = x 

raj = Geek() 

# setting the age using setter 
raj.set_age(21) 

# retrieving age using getter 
print(raj.get_age()) #output 21

print(raj._age) #output 21

'''
The attribute _age is not truly private. By convention, attributes starting with a single underscore (_) are considered 
"protected" in Python, meaning they are intended for internal use but can still be accessed directly if needed.
Therefore, accessing _age directly using raj._age works without any restriction.

#2nd approach(double __private attribute )
'''
âœ… Getter and Setter Methods
These are special methods used to safely access and update private attributes.
The correct and recommended way to access or modify private attribute is through getter and setter methods.
'''

class Geek:
    def __init__(self,age=0):
        self.__age=age
    
    def get_age(self):
        return self.__age
    
    def set_age(self,x):
        self.__age=x

obj= Geek()

obj.set_age(39)

print(obj.get_age())

print(obj.__age)


'''
The attribute __age is truly private because of name mangling in Python.

Attributes starting with double underscores (__) are renamed internally by Python to prevent accidental access or overriding. 
This is called name mangling.

Internally, self.__age is renamed to _Geek__age to make it harder to access directly.

Therefore, trying to access obj.__age directly raises an AttributeError, as Python does not find an attribute named __age.
'''

'''
ðŸš« Direct Access (Not Recommended)
You can technically access private attributes using name mangling:

		print(obj._Geek__age)

This breaks encapsulation and should be avoided unless you're debugging or working in special cases.

@property decorator

The @property decorator works for both not truly private means protected (single _age) 
and truly private means private (double __age) attributes. 
This is because the @property decorator creates a layer of abstraction that allows controlled access to an attribute, 
regardless of whether the attribute is "protected" (single _) or "private" (double __).

#previous code getter and setter method example with property decorator 
class Geek:
    def __init__(self,age=0):
        self.__age=age
    
    # Getter using @property
    @property
    def age(self):
        print("getter method called")
        return self.__age

    # Setter using @property_name.setter
    @age.setter #@functionname.setter
    def age(self,x):
        if(x<18):
            raise ValueError("Sorry you age is below eligibility criteria")
        print("setter method called") 
        self.__age=x

# Create an object
obj= Geek()

# Modify private attribute like a regular variable
obj.age=39 #instead of obj.set_age(39)

print(obj.age)#instead of obj.get_age() and  __age


'''
Getter and Setter and property why used :Explanation

Getter:
    Used to access the value of a private attribute.
    Defined as a method that returns the value of the attribute.

Setter:
    Used to modify the value of a private attribute.
    Defined as a method that updates the value with some additional logic, if needed.

Property Decorator (@property):
    A Python feature to create getters and setters in a concise way.
    Allows using an attribute-like syntax (obj.attribute) to interact with private variables, while still having full control through methods.
