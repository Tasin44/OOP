‚úÖ Step-by-step Execution
1. Decorator Definition

def calculate_time(factoria):

    Step 1: A function named calculate_time is defined, which accepts another function (factoria) as an argument.

    Purpose: This is the decorator function that wraps another function with timing logic.

    def inner1(*args, **kwargs):

    Step 2: Inside calculate_time, another function inner1 is defined. This will replace the original factorial function.

    Purpose: inner1 will add extra functionality ‚Äî in this case, timing.

        begin = time.time()

    Step 3: Start timer right before calling the actual function.

        factoria(*args, **kwargs)

    Step 4: Call the original function (factorial) passed to the decorator with any arguments.

    Note: This is where the original logic (sleep + factorial calculation) happens.

        end = time.time()

    Step 5: End timer after function execution finishes.

        print("Total time taken in : ", factoria.__name__, end - begin)

    Step 6: Print the time taken for the function to run.

    return inner1

    Step 7: Return the inner1 function, which now includes timing logic.

    Effect: factorial = calculate_time(factorial) implicitly because of the decorator syntax.

üß† Behind the Scenes: Decorator Application

@calculate_time
def factorial(num):

    Step 8: The @calculate_time decorator is applied to the factorial function.

    Effect: Python translates this as:

factorial = calculate_time(factorial)

Now factorial refers to inner1, not the original function.
üîÅ Function Call

factorial(10)

    Step 9: You're calling inner1(10) now.

    Inside inner1:

        Time starts

        time.sleep(2) and math.factorial(10) run

        Time ends

        Duration is printed

üßæ Final Output Example:

3628800
Total time taken in :  factorial 2.002134084701538

If we want to do it without decorator:

# decorator to calculate duration taken by any function.
#Decorator Definition:

        end = time.time()
        print("Total time taken in : ", factorialf.__name__, end - begin)

    return inner1

#Without Decorator Application:
