#Subclassing (Calling constructor of parent class)

#Single Inheritance: A child class inherits from one parent class.
'''
The super() function is a built-in function that returns the ✅objects 
that represent the parent class. 
It allows to access the parent class’s methods and attributes in the child class.
It enabling you to extend and customize the functionality inherited from the parent class.
'''
class Person(object):# ✅ Correct inheritance(object)
    def __init__(self,name,id):
        self.name=name
        self.id=id
    def display(self):
        return f'{self.name},his id {self.id},income: {self.salary}, designation: {self.position}'

class Employee(Person):
    def __init__(self,name,id,salary,position):

        # Initialize the parent class attributes first
        super().__init__(name, id)  # Recommended way to call parent class's __init__
        
        """or we can also do in this way """
        #Person.__init__(self,name,id)
        
        '''
        If we don't invoke the __init__() of the parent class then 
        its instance variables would not be available to the child class.
        '''
        # Then initialize the child class specific attributes
        self.salary=salary
        self.position=position

obj=Employee("Tasin",62,62000,"intern")

print(obj.display())

1. What is object in class Person(object):?

    In Python, object is the base class for all new-style classes.

    Writing class Person(object): means Student inherits from Python's built-in object type.

    It gives the class useful features like:

        support for super()

        better method resolution order (MRO)

        descriptors and properties

❗ Why not use something like obj?

Because:

    obj is not defined as a class—it’s just a name.

    Python will raise a NameError if you write class Student(obj): and obj isn’t a valid class name.
'''



'''
1.The display method in the Person class take references of self.salary and self.position.

2.Must be wirte Person.__init__(self,name,id) before 
self.salary=salary
self.position=position
because  it's generally good practice to call the parent class's __init__ method 
before initializing attributes specific to the child class if the parent class 
depends on those attributes. 

Initialization Order: 
The super() function is the recommended way to call the parent class's methods because it ensures proper method resolution order (MRO) in cases of multiple inheritance.

The parent class __init__ method should be called first 
to set up the name and id attributes.

Child-Specific Attributes: After calling the parent class __init__ method, 
the salary and position attributes specific to the Employee class are initialized.

'''

'''

Protected, Public, and Private Members:

super() and Person.__init__(...) can access public and protected members of the parent class without any issues.
For private members (those with names starting with __, like __salary), name mangling applies.
